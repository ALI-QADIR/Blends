# Blender Learning Projects

This repository contains various Blender projects that I created while learning Blender. Each project is contained in a separate subdirectory and includes a Blender file (.blend) as well as any associated assets used in the project.

## Project Descriptions

Below are the descriptions of each project with accompanying images as suitable.

### Anvil

Anvil was a project that allowed me to learn how to use the boolean modifier and how to bake normal maps from a high poly model to a low poly model. I created a low poly model of an anvil and duplicated it to create a high poly model. After sculpting the high poly model to add more details, I baked a normal map to the low poly model.

### Bulb

The Bulb project helped me learn how to create different types of materials in Blender. I created materials like glass, metal, plastic, wood, and applied them to the bulb model.

### Chair

The Chair project helped me learn hard surface modeling and basic camera motion and animation. I created a chair model and added different textures to it to make it look more realistic.

### Cup

The Cup project was created to learn how to create a material with a transparent background. I used a node editor to create a material and added a texture to it. The model also has materials for liquid without actually simulating the liquid.

### Cross

The Cross project was created for a music video for an artist. It showcases camera motion and animation along with emission materials, transparency, and particle systems. It also showcases graph editor animation and driver animations.

### Donut

The Donut project was the introductory project to Blender. I created a donut model to learn the basics of Blender and to get familiar with the interface and all the basic tools and features of Blender.

## Usage

Each project is contained in a separate subdirectory. Each subdirectory contains a Blender file (.blend) as well as any associated assets used in the project. To open a project, simply open the .blend file in Blender.
